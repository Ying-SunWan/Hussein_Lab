                            research thrust has been devoted to understanding the optical emission from such interactions that range from visible to
                            hard x-ray photon energies with a particular interest in high harmonic generation. I enjoy rock climbing (bouldering),

                            currently working on Laser breakdown spectroscopy for soil analysis. As a part of my Master’s Thesis, I have conducted a
                            theoretical and experimental analysis of the interaction between mid infrared nano-second laser pulses and water to
                            develop a laser-assisted bioprinting system. I am highly motivated to research in the field of laser-plasma interaction,
                            plasma accelerator, spectroscopy, laser ablation, and ultrafast laser optics. Besides this, I love to join different
                            scientific student clubs in which I can actively participate in conferences, workshops, and scientific talks. In
                            addition, football is my favorite sport, and I enjoy playing as a defensive midfielder.</p></div>

                            Alberta. Before I joined the lab, I graduated with MSc & DIC from Imperial College London. My MSc individual research
                            project was based on microwave heating. For my PhD, I am currently performing Monte Carlo simulation of focused laser
                            wakefield accelerated electron beams striking the copper stack with and without a lead converter to study the generation
                            of gamma rays. My upcoming research work will be examining and characterizing the intricate mechanical processes in
                            additively manufactured materials via laser-driven X-ray imaging. My research interest encompasses laser wakefield
                            accelerators, compact laser-driven accelerator X-ray and γ-ray sources, streamer discharge phenomena, and indirect‐drive
                            inertial confinement fusion. Furthermore, my curiosity to learn more about lasers led me to take part in 2021 Siegman
                            Summer School. My hobbies include cooking, visiting museums and being an occasional reptile watcher.</p> </div>
