            I completed my PhD in Applied Physics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2019, where I was a member of the
            Gérard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science and conducted experiments using the (former) most intense laser
            system in the world. Before that, I received a MS in Nuclear Engineering from Purdue University and a BSc in Honours
            Physics from McGill University. I was a University of California President’s Postdoctoral Fellow in the department of
            Physics & Astronomy at the University of California Irvine from 2019-2020 before joining the faculty of Electrical &
            Computer Engineering as an Assistant Professor in 2020. <br /> <br />
            In 2021, I was elected Co-Chair of the User's Committee for the largest consortium of high-power laser facilities in
            North America, the US Department of Energy led LaserNetUS. I am also a member of the Strategic Planning Committee of the
            highest power laser system in Canada - the Advanced Laser Light Source in Varennes, Québec. In 2021, I was elected to
            the Executive Council of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Jupiter Laser Facility Users' Group. <br /> <br />
            Currently, I serve as a Co-Director of Outreach/Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Decolonization for the Department of
            Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta and a member of the American Physical Society Women+ in
            Plasma Physics committee. I am actively involved with University of Alberta Energy Systems Signature Area as a founding
            member and organizer of the COP Hack: Student Engagement initiative, and a member of the Energy Systems Signature Area
            Curriculum Committee - check out our series Exploring Energy Systems!<br /> <br />
            I'm always excited to support student initiatives and have been a faculty mentor for the AlbertaSat student team
            developing the Iris multispectral imager since 2020. I'm also a member of the Institute of Space Science, Exploration
            and Technology and an active supporter of Women in Scholarship, Engineering, Science and Technology at the UofA.<br /> <br />

                        <p>My PhD research at the University of California, Irvine focused on studying the wavelength
                            scaling of relativistic laser-solid interactions through both experimental and theoretical methods. My main
                            research thrust has been devoted to understanding the optical emission from such interactions that range from visible to
                            hard x-ray photon energies with a particular interest in high harmonic generation. I enjoy rock climbing (bouldering),
                            watching soccer, and playing games when I have time.</p>

                            at the University of Alberta. Before that, I have completed an MSc in Light Science and Technologies from the University

                            currently working on Laser breakdown spectroscopy for soil analysis. As a part of my Master’s Thesis, I have conducted a
                            theoretical and experimental analysis of the interaction between mid infrared nano-second laser pulses and water to
                            develop a laser-assisted bioprinting system. I am highly motivated to research in the field of laser-plasma interaction,
                            plasma accelerator, spectroscopy, laser ablation, and ultrafast laser optics. Besides this, I love to join different
                            scientific student clubs in which I can actively participate in conferences, workshops, and scientific talks. In

                            project was based on microwave heating. For my PhD, I am currently performing Monte Carlo simulation of focused laser
                            wakefield accelerated electron beams striking the copper stack with and without a lead converter to study the generation
                            of gamma rays. My upcoming research work will be examining and characterizing the intricate mechanical processes in
                            additively manufactured materials via laser-driven X-ray imaging. My research interest encompasses laser wakefield
                            accelerators, compact laser-driven accelerator X-ray and γ-ray sources, streamer discharge phenomena, and indirect‐drive
                            inertial confinement fusion. Furthermore, my curiosity to learn more about lasers led me to take part in 2021 Siegman

                        University; I had already completed 3/5 in Petrochemical Engineering there. My journey to becoming a Petroleum Engineer
                        is definitely a long one, but it is worth the effort! I am currently employing Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy
                        (LIBS) in measuring Bitumen concentrations of oil sand tailing samples as a new, rapid and simple method in the field. I

                        MSc in Soil Science in Fall 2021. For my master’s project, I will be examining how soil carbon capture efficiency and
                        soil health are affected by different agronomic management practices. I hope to use the expertise I have attained — and
                        will continue to develop — to enhance the sustainability of human society. My hobbies include songwriting, reading, and
