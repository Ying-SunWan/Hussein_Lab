        bio: "I completed my PhD in Applied Physics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2019, where I was a member of the  \
        Gérard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science and conducted experiments using the (former) most intense laser system \
        in the world. Before that, I received a MS in Nuclear Engineering from Purdue University and a BSc in Honours Physics from \
        McGill University. I was a University of California President’s Postdoctoral Fellow in the department of Physics & Astronomy \
        at the University of California Irvine from 2019 - 2020 before joining the faculty of Electrical & Computer Engineering as \
        an Assistant Professor in 2020. <br /> <br /> \
        In 2021, I was elected Co-Chair of the User's Committee for the largest consortium of high-power laser facilities in North \
        America, the US Department of Energy led LaserNetUS.I am also a member of the Strategic Planning Committee of the highest \
        power laser system in Canada - the Advanced Laser Light Source in Varennes, Québec.In 2021, I was elected to the Executive \
        Council of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Jupiter Laser Facility Users' Group. <br /> <br /> \
        Currently, I serve as a Co-Director of Outreach/Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Decolonization for the Department of Electrical \
        and Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta and a member of the American Physical Society Women+ in Plasma Physics \
        committee.I am actively involved with University of Alberta Energy Systems Signature Area as a founding member and organizer \
        of the COP Hack: Student Engagement initiative, and a member of the Energy Systems Signature Area Curriculum Committee - check \
        out our series Exploring Energy Systems! <br /> <br /> \
        I'm always excited to support student initiatives and have been a faculty mentor for the AlbertaSat student team developing \
        the Iris multispectral imager since 2020. I'm also a member of the Institute of Space Science, Exploration and Technology and \
        an active supporter of Women in Scholarship, Engineering, Science and Technology at the UofA.",
